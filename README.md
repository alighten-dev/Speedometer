# Speedometer
NinjaTrader 8 indicator that calculates the number of bars per (2)minute based on a configurable lookback period. 

1. Calculate the number of bars per two minutes based on a 20 bar lookback period (configurable). I chose two minutes because the numbers relate to highway speeds for my preferred bars.
2. Displays the speed in the top right corner of the chart.
3. Displays in black (configurable) if the speed is below your threshold (configurable) or green if your speed is above your threshold.
4. Can be configured to send an email or text message when the speed crosses your threshold, if you have an SMTP service configured in NinjaTrader.
